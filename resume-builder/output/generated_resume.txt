\section{projects}
Given the applicant's background in Mechanical Engineering and focus on data analytics/Python,  a direct match to the React.js front-end developer role is weak.  However, we can highlight transferable skills by focusing on projects demonstrating problem-solving, data analysis, and technical proficiency.  The job description emphasizes front-end development, which is absent from the applicant's experience.  Therefore, we will focus on showcasing transferable skills.

Here's a revised Projects section focusing on transferable skills:


**Projects**

1. **Project Title:** Pandas Data Wizard: Streamlining Data Processing
   **Start and End Date:**  [Insert Dates - likely Oct 2023 - Apr 2024, if this was during internship]
   **Brief Description:** Designed & implemented data transformation tool improving data integrity and efficiency.
   **Tools/Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, ETL, SQL, Data Integrity processes
   **Key Achievement:**  Improved data processing speed and ensured data uniformity, leading to more reliable insights. (Quantify if possible, e.g., "Reduced processing time by X%")


2. **Project Title:** Transaction Efficiency Analysis and Optimization
   **Start and End Date:** [Insert Dates - likely Oct 2023 - Apr 2024, if this was during internship]
   **Brief Description:** Analyzed transactional data to optimize machine efficiency and create performance dashboards.
   **Tools/Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Power BI, SQL, Excel
   **Key Achievement:** Developed a dashboard improving machine efficiency by [Quantify improvement if possible, e.g., "X%"].


**Note:**  The "Evaluation of Stress Concentration Factor" project, while impressive, is less relevant to the front-end developer role and should be omitted or placed lower in priority in the resume.  The focus needs to be on skills that *do* align with the job description, even if it means omitting some accomplishments.  The applicant should strongly consider gaining some experience with front-end technologies (like React) to improve their chances of securing this type of role.


Education:
\section{education}
**Education**

* **Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) - Mechanical Engineering** | Government College of Engineering, Tirunelveli | 2019 - 2023 | CGPA: 7.85  *(While not directly related to the React.js developer role, this demonstrates a strong foundation in engineering principles and problem-solving, transferable skills valued in software development.)*
* **Higher Secondary Education (Maths – Biology)** | Kings Matric Higher Secondary School, Valliyur | 2017 - 2019 | Grade: 80%
